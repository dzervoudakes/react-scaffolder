## A Homegrown React Template Generator

While tools like Create React App and Next are objectively awesome, over time I've decided that I want to learn more about the engine behind the application. As such, I started crafting and evolving my own React + Webpack configuration over time as a learning experience.

I have since decided to share my work with the open source community. Love it or loathe it, I will not be happy or offended either way. 😄

## Using the Generator

This scaffolding tool is a [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator, and requires that `yo` be installed. After installing `yo`, run the following commands.

### Install the Generator

NPM

```sh
npm install -g generator-react-scaffolder
```

Yarn

```sh
yarn global add generator-react-scaffolder
```

### Scaffold a New React Template

To begin the scaffolding process:

```sh
yo react-scaffolder
```

At this stage, you will be prompted to provide the following:

- Application name, any text of your choosing
- Yarn, yes or no

### With Options

Generate with TypeScript:

```sh
yo react-scaffolder --typescript

// alternatively
yo react-scaffolder --ts
```

The generator will attempt to install dependencies for you by default, though this operation can be disabled:

```sh
yo react-scaffolder --skip-install
```

### What's Included

✅ **Rendering:** client-side only\
✅ **Syntax:** react, js, jsx, ts, tsx, mjs\
✅ **Tooling:** eslint, stylelint, editorconfig, babel (non-TypeScript template only)\
✅ **Styling:** scss, css, postcss, css module syntax (`*.module.scss` and `*.module.css` nomenclature supported)\
✅ **Testing:** jest, react testing library\
✅ **Build instructions:** provided via the `README.md` file generated with each new scaffold

### What's Not Included

❌ **Script ejection:** there are links to the default webpack config on github in each `webpack.*.js` file\
❌ **Environment variables:** the boilerplate is agnostic to your preferred implementation for consuming env vars
