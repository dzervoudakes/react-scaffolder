## The Concept: Similar to Create React App, Not a Replacement

Create React App is an objectively _awesome_ tool and I have nothing but nice things to say about it. Over time, I've decided that I want to learn more about the engine behind the application, and so I started crafting and evolving my own React + Webpack configuration over time as a learning experience.

I have since decided to share my work with the open source community. Love it or loathe it, I will not be happy or offended either way. ðŸ˜„

## Using the Generator

This scaffolding tool is a [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) generator, and requires `yo` to be installed. After installing `yo`, run the following commands:

### Install the Generator
```
npm install -g generator-react-scaffolder
```

### Scaffold a New React Template

You will be prompted to enter the name of your application at this step.

```
yo react-scaffolder
```

## Build Options

Generate a new template with TypeScript:

```
yo react-scaffolder --typescript
```

By default, the generator will attempt to install dependencies for you via `npm`. If you or your organization do not use `npm`, you should skip this option as the generator has no support for `bower` or `yarn`.

```
yo react-scaffolder --skip-install
```

## Notes

* Build instructions are provided within the `README.md` file generated for each new scaffold
* Configuration for `jest` and `@testing-library/react` are installed automatically, with no `enzyme` support out of the box
* Each generated application supports both `.scss` and `.css` imports
* As this generator was built with my own personal preferences in mind, the formatting and other tooling are inherently nitpicky and opinionated out of the box, including `Prettier` and `Stylelint`
* `lint-staged` is wired up along with `husky` to further maintain quality and consistent formatting on pre-commit
* `jsdoc` is also included along with the `docdash` theme
* No `redux` or any other state management configuration is included
* The base `webpack` configuration can handle basically any and all file import types you may think of, though the configuration is exposed so you may tweak it to suit your needs and preferences
